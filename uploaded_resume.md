**Data Science Apprentice, iNeuron Intelligence Pvt Ltd**

**October 2022 - January 2023**

As a Data Science apprentice at iNeuron intelligence, I collaborated with senior Data Scientists on real-world projects emphasizing MLops implementation. Conducted EDA and feature engineering to uncover patterns, revealing insights crucial for model training. 

MLops: Developed system architecture and deployment pipelines for data ingestion, transformation, model training and inference, implementing MLops practices to ensure seamless integration and scalability. 

**PROJECTS**

**iNeuron Intelligence Pvt Ltd | October 2022 - January 2023**

**1\) Sensor Fault Detection **

Addressed faults in the Air Pressure System \(APS\) of heavy-duty vehicles to prevent unnecessary repairs and minimize costs by developing a binary classification model to classify whether the damage is APS system or other parts of the vehicle by building micro service components using MLops. 

Developed a Data pipeline by leveraging benefits of Apache Kafka to store real-time streaming data from APS sensors and MongoDB for consuming stored data from Kafka for enabling model online learning. 

Then training pipeline that involved data ingestion from MongoDB, EDA and Feature Engineering operations through Data validation and transformation, phases, training XGBoost model to achieve high accuracy in model training and model evaluation phase to replace better accuracy model over production model, deployment using GitHub Workflows CI/CD pipeline to host the application on AWS EC2. 

Tech Stack & Infrastructure**:** Python, FastAPI, ScikitLearn, Docker, MongoDB, AWS s3, ECR, EC2, Git Actions \(CI/CD\) **2\) Finance Complaint **

Identified problematic complaints against financial products to facilitate the company to take quick actions on those and satisfying customer needs. Developed an end to end ML application training and CI/CD pipeline following same system architecture designed for Sensor fault detection project. Utilized PySpark ML framework distributed computing to train model efficiently over large data of customer complaints. 

Utilized Airflow as scheduler for scheduling model training on new data in a define time interval for enabling incremental learning and overcome problems such as model rot. 

Tech Stack and Infrastructure:** **Python, FastAPI, PySpark, PySparkML, Docker, Airlflow, Git Actions, AWS S3, ECR, EC2. 

**Celebal Technologies | June 2023 - March 2024**

**1\) Face Authentication System **

Developed Face Authentication system featuring transfer learning of pretrained models MTCNN and FaceNet for face detection and embedding Generation. 

Developed two primary flows: registration and login, enabling users to register their details and capture face embeddings for logging in authentication. 

Leveraged MongoDB for storing these details data and hosted the application using Azure Container Registry and Azure web App service. 



**2\) Azure Search OpenAI Retrieval Augmented Generation chatbot for clients \(P.O.C\)** Developed robust data preparation and indexing pipeline that automatically extracts the content from clients documents stored in Azure Blob storage by leveraging advance features of Azure Form Recognizer and creates an index of the extracted content in Azure Cognitive Search. 

And Retrieval Augmented Generation pipeline to retrieve relevant information to user’s query from created index by utilizing vector semantic search feature of ACS and generating natural human language response of this query content by utilizing Azure OpenAI GPT 3.5 LLM to deliver ChatGPT

like experiences to users. 

Incorporated enhancements include Azure OpenAI GPT4 Vision LMM for image retrieval along with text output to the user queries. Replaced Azure Cognitive search with Neo4j Graph database to witness its benefits of retrieving content from multiple documents, this advancements aids LLM in providing analytical answers. 

**PERSONAL PROJECTS**

**1\) Reverse Image Search Engine with ANN, CLIP and GPT4 Vision \(NLP and GEN AI\)** Addressed few drawbacks in my Azure OpenAI Chatbot for clients P.O.C, chatbot is only capable of giving text outputs to user queries. 

Developed a pipeline to overcome these limitations by leveraging the benefits of CLIP foundational model and the Approximate Nearest Neighbor \(ANN\) algorithm. This enhanced chatbot capability to accept both text and images as input and provide relevant responses containing both images and text. 

Later my team and I enhanced it functionality by replacing CLIP with Azure OpenAI’s GPT 4 Vision LMM, achieving better performance and cost saving for clients by utilizing the features of ANN in place Azure Cognitive Search. 

**2\) Image Segmentation and Object Detection with Detectron2 Framework **

Developed an Object detection and segmentation vision applications using the Detectron2 Framework’s RCNN pretrained models from Facebook AI Research \(FAIR\). 

Manually labelled the images using LabelMe software for segmentation and detection use cases, and utilized COCO framework code to convert this labelled data into a COCO Format JSON data to enable training. 

Implemented Transfer learning of Detectron2 RCNN pretrained models on this COCO formatted images to address the specific vision tasks like Leaf disease segmentation and vehicle number plate detection at traffic junctions.
